# Grocery King üõí

**Grocery King** is a frontend-only web application designed to simulate an online grocery shopping experience. Users can browse available grocery items, add items to their cart, and view their cart summary. This project serves as an educational tool and does not include a backend; instead, it relies on sample data to demonstrate core features.

## Features

- **Grocery Catalog**: Browse a variety of grocery items with images, prices, and types.
- **Add to Cart**: Select items to add to the shopping cart, with cart persistence using `localStorage`.
- **Cart Summary**: View items in the cart, total price, and clear the cart as needed.
- **Navigation**: Quickly switch between the shopping page and cart summary.

## Project Structure

- **Data**: Static sample grocery data is stored in `public/data/data.json` and includes items with names, prices, images, and types (e.g., meat, vegetables, soup).
- **Components**:
  - **App** (`App.js`): Main application component with routing setup for `Buy` and `Profile` pages.
  - **Buy** (`Buy.js`): Displays grocery items fetched from `data.json` and provides an option to add items to the cart.
  - **GroceryBuyWidget** (`BuyWidget.js`): Individual grocery item widget with image, price, type, and "Add to Cart" button.
  - **Profile** (`Profile.js`): Displays cart items, total price, and provides a button to clear the cart.
  - **Navigation** (`Nav.js`): A simple navbar to switch between the shopping page and cart.
- **Styling**: Custom CSS files for each component are located in `src/styles/`.

## Data Structure

The `data.json` file in `public/data/` contains an array of grocery items in this format:
```json
{
  "name": "baked beans",
  "price": 0.40,
  "image": "/images/beans.png",
  "type": "vegetables"
}
